# CLAUDE.md — AI Agent Instructions for mcp-auto

## Project
mcp-auto is a stateless Go proxy that converts HTTP REST APIs into MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools.
Full design: SPEC.md

## Module
github.com/lega4e/mcp-auto

## Commands

### Build
make build        # go build ./cmd/proxy

### Lint (must pass before every commit)
make lint         # golangci-lint run ./...

### Vet (must pass before every commit)
make vet          # go vet ./...

### Unit tests (must pass before every commit)
make test         # go test -race -count=1 ./...

### Integration tests (require Docker)
make integration  # go test -tags integration ... ./tests/integration/...

Without `PROXY_IMAGE`, tests build the proxy from source using the Dockerfile. Set `PROXY_IMAGE` to test against a pre-built image (used in CI).

### All checks (run before every commit)
make check        # runs lint + vet + test + build in sequence

## Pre-commit checklist
1. Run `make check` and fix all failures before committing.
2. Run `make integration` and fix all failures before committing.

Never commit with failing lint, vet, unit tests, or integration tests.

## Integration tests
Integration tests live in `tests/integration/` with build tag `//go:build integration`. They run the proxy as a Docker container alongside test fixtures (WireMock, etc.) using Testcontainers. They do NOT import internal packages — they test the built image end-to-end via HTTP and MCP protocol.

**You MUST run `make integration` after implementing any feature or fix and ensure all integration tests pass.** If an integration test fails, diagnose and fix the issue before committing. Do not skip or ignore integration test failures.

## No panicking

**NEVER use `panic()` anywhere in this codebase — not in library code, not in `init()`, not in factories, not in tests.**

All error conditions must be surfaced by returning an `error` value. Functions that can fail must return `(*T, error)` or `error`. Call sites must propagate or wrap errors using `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`.

The only acceptable alternative is a log-and-exit pattern in `main()` for truly unrecoverable startup failures (e.g. missing required env var before any server has started). Even then, prefer `log.Fatal` / `slog` + `os.Exit(1)` over `panic`.

Examples of what to do instead of panicking:

```go
// BAD
func NewPool(max int64) *Pool {
    if max <= 0 { panic("max must be > 0") }
    ...
}

// GOOD
func NewPool(max int64) (*Pool, error) {
    if max <= 0 { return nil, fmt.Errorf("new pool: max must be > 0, got %d", max) }
    ...
}
```

```go
// BAD
func Register(name string, f Factory) {
    if name == "" { panic("name must not be empty") }
    ...
}

// GOOD
func Register(name string, f Factory) error {
    if name == "" { return fmt.Errorf("register: name must not be empty") }
    ...
}
```

## Code conventions
- All errors must be wrapped with context: `fmt.Errorf("loading spec: %w", err)`
- Structured logging via `log/slog` with `slog.Default()`; keys are snake_case
- No global mutable state; pass dependencies explicitly
- Interfaces are defined in the package that uses them, not the package that implements them
- Use `context.Context` as the first argument in all functions that do I/O or call other services
- All config fields that reference secrets use `${ENV_VAR}` syntax; never log expanded values
- Unit tests live in files named `*_test.go` with no build tag

## Additional rules
See `.claude/rules/` for scoped rules on integration tests, OpenAPI package patterns, and common review issues.

## Active development
This project has no public users. There is no backward compatibility requirement. Interfaces, config schemas, and APIs may change freely between tasks.

## No stubs
Implementation tasks must produce complete, working code. Do not write placeholder functions that return `nil, nil` or `errors.New("not implemented")`. If a feature is not yet needed, do not create the function at all.

## No "all" bundle packages
NEVER create `<pkg>/all/all.go` packages that re-export sub-packages via blank imports. They are an anti-pattern: they couple every sub-package together, defeating tree-shaking, and obscure which dependencies are actually pulled in. Instead, import individual sub-packages directly wherever they are needed (e.g. in `cmd/proxy/deps/deps.go`).
